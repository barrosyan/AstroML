# AstroML
Welcome to AstroML project. Initially designed to be a Galaxies classifier CNN model, now is turning into an web-application!

## At this moment, I've passed through those steps:
1. Scraped Galaxies pictures and information from Nasa and ESO (European Southern Observatory) public webpage.
2. Develope initial frontend interface.
3. Develop initial backend routes.
4. Build my CNN architecture.

## Those are the next steps:
5. Separate and organize data on 10 different galaxies classifications to train my CNN model (using Keras Tensorflow).
6. Train and test the model.
7. Valuate requests to backend by ML model.
8. Create the galaxies identifier ML model.
9. Apply the Python package Astropy to astrophysics calculum.
10. Go further into other topics I've already scrapped.

Feel free to colaborate!
