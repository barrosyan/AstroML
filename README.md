# ClimatePlanetsClassification
This is an on going project to classificate planets weather, using ML.

## At this moment, I've passed through those steps:
1. Becoming familiar with Weather API's to scraping information for each latitude/longitude combination.

## Those are the next steps:
2. Create a Dataset on PostgreSQL with weather information and climate classification for Earth;
3. Stablish the most important variables for each weather;
4. Create a Dataset with Solar System planets weather information;
5. Develop my ML Classification model to predict planets weather.
