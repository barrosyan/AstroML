# AstroML
This is an on going project to initially classificate galaxies, starsm, planets, etc using CNN models.

## At this moment, I've passed through those steps:
1. Scraped Galaxies pictures and information from Nasa and ESO (European Southern Observatory) public webpage.

## Those are the next steps:
2. Separate and organize data on 4 different galaxies classifications to train my CNN model (using Keras Tensorflow).
3. Build my CNN architecture.
4. Train and test the model.
5. Measure results, test with other data and create visualizations.
6. Do it for other classifications.
7. Do mathematical, phyisical and statistical from photos, using OpenCV to image proccessing.
